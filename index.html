   If you're like me, you come home from a long Monday, pop open the ice cream, and tune in to CBS to watch the best feminist show on television, <i> Supergirl </i>. Unfortunately, the network has not announced whether or not they will renew the show for a second season, and they are making viewers very antsy. Lucky for fans, CBS has strongly hinted at a renewal. While we wait in suspense, let's reflect on season 1 and think about all the reasons that <i> Supergirl </i> should come back to TV.

   <ol>
   <li><i> Supergirl </i> is great for children and adults alike.
   Every Monday, my stepdad, brothers and I gather around the TV to watch <i> Supergirl </i>. Besides the occasional curse, there is nothing that a 5 year old can't handle. Also, Melissa Benoist, the actress who plays the title character, wears a dress that someone actually might wear around and not feel embarassed. At first, when I heard that <i> Supergirl </i> was coming out, I thought they would make Kara Danvers look extremely innapropriate. But time has been good to Supergirl, and now she is more powerful than ever. </li>
   <li> MELISSA BENOIST!!!!!!
   Seriously, is there anything that girl can't do? We originally saw Benoist in Glee, and she stole our hearts. Now, she has stepped up to the plate and taken her craft to a whole new level with <i> Supergirl</i>. She is the perfect actress for this role, as she is powerful, smart, mysterious, and gorgeous. I can't imagine the show without her. I might not even have watched it. (Just kidding, that would never happen.) Anyway, she's amazing in every possible way. </li>
   <li> Kara's awesome supporting cast. This is probably going to be the longest section (sorry) because I have so much to say. Let's start with Mechad Brooks. He's so adorable and he steals our heart just as much as Melissa does. Chyler Leigh. How to describe her in 3 words. Supergirl. Number. Two. As her mother Eliza said to her, "You have always been my Supergirl." Jeremy Jordan might beat Mechad Brooks. He tries so hard to win Kara's heart!! David Harewood wasn't a standout at the beginning of the season, but once we found out about his true identity and story, we fell in love with J'onn J'onz. </li>
